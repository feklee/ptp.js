Introduction
============

*ptp.js* is a JavaScript library providing *limited* functionality for
controlling cameras via [PTP][1]/IP: *Picture Transfer Protocol* via an
IP-based network

The first version of the library was developed by [Felix][3] for interfacing
with a [Ricoh Theta][2]. On Firefox Marketplace you find the result:
[Theta Control][13]

An inspiration was `ThetaShutterProc.c`, a set of C functions part of
[ThetaShutter_PQIAirPen002.zip][6] by [MobileHackerz][4]. *ptp.js* has a
different architecture, however, making use of JavaScript’s functional nature.


Documentation
=============

Basic usage:

 1. Load the module, depending on platform:

      + B2G ([TCP Socket API][8]): AMD module `scripts/ptp.js`

      + Node.js module

    An object is created, let’s call it `ptp`.

 2. Interface with the camera via properties such as `ptp.host` and functions
    such as `ptp.connect()`.

For an example, see demos:

  + B2G: Firefox OS app (`manifest.webapp`)

  + Node.js: `node_demo/app.js`

    Note for Windows users: Due to Node.js [issue #3584][14], output may be
    missing when using redirection, for example with `more`.


Limitations
===========

  * Incompleteness: Many PTP functions are missing.

  * Only tested with one camera, the Ricoh Theta.

Coding conventions
------------------

  * Code needs to validate with JSLint.

  * Comments are in Markdown.

  * Don’t use constructors: JavaScript is a classless language.

  * Don’t throw exceptions. JavaScript is a weakly typed language, allowing
    functions to return different types of values, including types indicating
    errors.

  * Versioning: [major.minor.patch][7]

    Keep version up to date in:

      + Git tags

      + `package.json`
